This is our University project. A 2D game based on Tetris and Scrubbles and implemented with Unity/C#.


## The Game
- - -
Do you also have the feeling that the time is passing faster and faster?
<br />Sure, as we get older we do less and less things that we will remember later. Every week we get up in the morning and manage our everyday life.
Due the current situation with Corona, our options to do something else - visit events or book trips without hesitation - have also been restricted. Instead of enjoying and to take time you have the feeling to find plenty of work to do and the time for the daily tasks get shorter and shorter.


## Gameplay
- - -
Okay, get start by clicking on the play-Button and let's go!
<br />It is a simple 2D game. The goal of the game is to form the word with the falling letters. You have only to touch the letter which you are need. And the order of the collected letters does not matter.
<br />But be careful! If you are hit by a falling letter, it costs energy!
<br />You can move your character by press the "left"- and "right"-key and moving the letter too and jump by pressing the "space"-key . You are strong enough and have the possibility to push the letter off the edge of the screen. 
<br />
<br />The challenge for you will be not to hit by a letter. The higher the level, the faster the letters falling down and the time gets also be shorter and shorter. But just as in real life, there are positive events. Try to catch the flying hearts by touching. They give you energy and can increase your score. 


## Final Words
- - -
Note that the letters are chosen at random. You can have so much luck and have the letters together very quickly which you are need. Or in the worst case you may not even have reached a word in the fifth and final level.
<br />At first try not to hit by the falling letters. It is just a game and you should have fun!
